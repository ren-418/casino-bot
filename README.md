**defi** - Decentralized Finance

**i18n** - Internationalization

## An attempt at bringing Decentralized Finance to everyone.

### How to use

Go to https://github.com/nanexcool/defi18n

Currently there's English and Spanish files for:

- General
- Dai Stats
- Maker

While defi18n will never rival a professional translation service, my hope is it can provide a good enough starting point for small teams and solo devs.

### Todo

- [ ] Translate this site obviously...
- [ ] More languages
- [ ] More categories
- [ ] CLI tool to mix packages together?
- [ ] Make NPM package
